## COE3DQ5 project

This project was to create a image decompressor for an FPGA board given some specific design conditions and theory to work off of. We implemented the system using System verilog and tested using modelSIM.
This project required multiple steps and work in realtime with memory systems and many limitations on the flow that caused it to be a challenging project. More information can be found in the report
